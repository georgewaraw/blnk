# BLNK
 
BLNK (blink? blank? not even sure myself) is a demo of a game that I will probably never make. It was born from a project so ambitious that I could not even get it running, sadly, and like the others, it will be recycled into future projects that will hopefully one day culminate in something resembling a full release. Visually, the title was inspired by the many PlayStation classics that I grew up playing, as well as the ones that I discovered long after my console had died. It was further inspired by the countless indies that made me interested in computer graphics in the first place. I tried to make it weird but cozy, and I think I got pretty close. Life has been kind of crazy for the past year or so, and this has helped me keep my head on straight as I went about my daily grind. As for the code, I tried to keep it as clean as possible, so if you see something you like, feel free to dig around and use it. If you have some questions or ideas, hit me up. If you are looking for some music for your game, also hit me up. Love and peace!
